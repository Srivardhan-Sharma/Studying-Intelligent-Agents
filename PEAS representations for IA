Intelligent agents are systems that perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals. Each agent is described using the PEAS framework:

P: Performance Measure – How success is measured.
E: Environment – The surroundings where the agent operates.
A: Actuators – The parts that allow the agent to act.
S: Sensors – The parts that help the agent perceive the environment.

1. Self-Driving Car 🚗
Performance Measure: Safe driving, reaching destination efficiently, following traffic laws, fuel efficiency.
Environment: Roads, pedestrians, traffic signals, weather conditions.
Actuators: Steering wheel, accelerator, brakes, turn signals.
Sensors: Cameras, LIDAR, GPS, speedometer, radar.

2. Chess-Playing AI ♟️
Performance Measure: Winning the game, minimizing losses, optimizing move efficiency.
Environment: Chessboard, opponent’s moves, time constraints.
Actuators: Moving chess pieces (if robotic), displaying moves on a screen (if virtual).
Sensors: Board position (camera for a robotic system or internal representation for a digital system).

3. Smart Personal Assistant (e.g., Siri, Google Assistant) 📱
Performance Measure: Providing accurate answers, understanding user intent, executing commands correctly.
Environment: User voice commands, background noise, internet.
Actuators: Voice output, screen display, smart home device control.
Sensors: Microphone, touchscreen, internet data.

4. Industrial Robot (e.g., Assembly Line Robot) 🤖
Performance Measure: Speed, precision, error rate, safety compliance.
Environment: Factory floor, conveyor belts, human workers.
Actuators: Robotic arms, grippers, welding tools.
Sensors: Cameras, pressure sensors, infrared sensors.

5. Recommendation System (e.g., Netflix, YouTube) 🎬
Performance Measure: User engagement, watch time, relevance of recommendations.
Environment: User preferences, viewing history, trending content.
Actuators: Displaying recommended content on the screen.
Sensors: User clicks, watch time, ratings, search history.

6. Autonomous Drone (e.g., Delivery Drone) ✈️
Performance Measure: Reaching destination safely, avoiding obstacles, battery efficiency.
Environment: Airspace, wind conditions, buildings, no-fly zones.
Actuators: Propellers, camera tilt, landing gear.
Sensors: GPS, cameras, ultrasonic sensors, altimeter.

7. Spam Email Filter 📧
Performance Measure: Accuracy in filtering spam, minimizing false positives.
Environment: Incoming emails, sender information, email content.
Actuators: Moving emails to the spam folder, flagging suspicious emails.
Sensors: Email text analysis, sender reputation, user feedback.

8. Medical Diagnosis AI 🏥
Performance Measure: Accuracy of diagnosis, minimizing false positives/negatives.
Environment: Patient records, symptoms, lab reports.
Actuators: Displaying diagnosis, suggesting treatments, alerting doctors.
Sensors: Medical reports, X-rays, patient symptoms entered by doctors.
