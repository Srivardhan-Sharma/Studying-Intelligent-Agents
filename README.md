logic paradigms

Propositional Logic: Deals with statements that are either true or false. Uses logical connectives like AND, OR, and NOT (e.g., "If it rains, the ground is wet").

First-Order Logic (FOL): Extends propositional logic by introducing quantifiers (∀ for all, ∃ for some) and relations between objects (e.g., "All humans are mortal").

Temporal Logic: Adds time-based reasoning, allowing statements about the past, present, and future (e.g., "The system will always be safe" → G(Safe)).

Probability Theory: Incorporates uncertainty into logic by assigning probabilities to events (e.g., "There is a 70% chance of rain tomorrow").

Fuzzy Logic: Allows reasoning with degrees of truth rather than just true/false (e.g., "This coffee is 80% hot instead of just hot or cold").
